Project Title: Ecommerce Mobile vs. Web Experience Analysis

Description:
This project focuses on helping an Ecommerce company based in New York City determine whether to prioritize their mobile app or website experience. The company specializes in selling clothing online and offers in-store styling sessions with personal stylists. Customers can meet with a stylist in-store and later purchase recommended items through the company's mobile app or website.

As a contracted data analyst/developer, I was tasked with analyzing user behavior, engagement, and preferences to provide actionable insights and guide the companyâ€™s decision-making process.

Goals:

Analyze data from mobile app and website usage.
Compare user engagement, purchase patterns, and customer satisfaction between the platforms.
Provide a clear recommendation on which platform to prioritize for future development.
Tools & Technologies Used:

Data analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)
Data visualization: Tableau/Matplotlib/Seaborn
Database management: SQL
Reporting and documentation: Jupyter Notebooks/GitHub
This project demonstrates my skills in data-driven decision-making and my ability to address real-world business challenges.
